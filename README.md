Restaurant Ratings Predictor Project README:
Introduction
I embarked on this project, drawing inspiration from an original assignment crafted by Brian Hou, Marvin Zhang, and John DeNero for CS 61A at UC Berkeley. Utilizing the Yelp academic dataset, my goal was to predict restaurant ratings using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on simple linear regressions. This README is a guide to the project's setup, structure, and how to get involved.

Project Overview
The project is structured into several Python files and a dataset directory:

abstractions.py: Here, I define the data abstractions for Restaurants, Users, and Reviews.
recommend.py: This file houses the machine learning algorithms and data processing tools.
utils.py: Contains utility functions for calculating statistics relevant to restaurants.
datafolder/: A directory filled with Yelp data on users, restaurants, and reviews in JSON format.

The main script you'll interact with is recommend.py, which uses the data abstractions and utility functions to make rating predictions. 

Contributing
I welcome any contributions to this project. Here are some ways you can help improve it:

Enhancing algorithms: Suggest and implement improvements to the machine learning algorithms for more accurate predictions.
Adding features: Contribute new functionalities, like filtering restaurants by categories or locations before making predictions.
Bug fixes: Identify and correct any issues in the code.
Documentation: Help make this README more informative or add comments to the code for better understandability.
If you're interested in contributing, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request describing your updates.

Testing
Testing is a critical part of this project. I encourage regular testing to ensure your code functions as expected. Alongside the provided doctests, consider creating your own unit tests to cover additional cases.

Acknowledgments
A huge thank you to Brian Hou, Marvin Zhang, and John DeNero for providing the inspiration and resources to kickstart this project.
